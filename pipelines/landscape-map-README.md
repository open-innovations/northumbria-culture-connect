## Build reference table

It is likely that the reference data will come from a number of sources.
At this stage, we are using Companies House bulk data as a source of
registered companies.

Benefits of using Companies House data include:

1. Ability to match to registered company names to remove issues with
   mistyped organisation names
2. Potential to map to a postcode for an organisation (with the caveat
   that this might be the postcode of the accountants).
3. Ability to harvest **SIC codes** for known cultural organisations
   to identify organisations working the sector who do not appear
   in the funding streams being used.
