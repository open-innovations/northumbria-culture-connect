The Culture Connect Data Observatory collects sources of data relating to
culture into a single online resource. This can be used by anyone with an
interest in culture, whether artists, producers, evaluators, policy makers or
researchers. We hope that this will enable our cultural organisations to have
more impact, make more of their budgets, while providing robust evidence of the
breadth of cultural engagement across the region.

In the site you will find [insights](/tag/insight/) using data for a specific
goal; [case studies](/tag/case-studies/) exploring best practice in data
collection, sharing and interpretation; and [data sources](/tag/data/)
showcasing the raw data that is available.

<p class="small">A note about geographic scope: the Data Observatory pilot is limited to Newcastle City Council area for the pilot phase, but we aspire to broaden this out as the project to build the Observatory progresses.</p>
