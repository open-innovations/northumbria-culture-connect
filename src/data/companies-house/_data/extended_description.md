Companies House provides open data on registered companies.
Each organisation provides up to four
[SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) codes](https://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic)
on registration.
Some of these either describe organisations that are engaged in the culture sector
(e.g. <span>90010 Performing arts</span>, <span>91020 Museums activities</span>).
Others clearly provide support or services to these organisations
(e.g. <span>90020 Support activities to performing arts</span>).

While many of the codes with a strong culture sector affinity are in Section R,
there are some which are clearly not part of this cluster
(e.g. <span>93110 Operation of sports facilities</span>, <span>93191 Activities of racehorse owners</span>)
Equally, there are organisations that are in related fields that appear elsewhere in the hierarchy of codes
(e.g. <span>59112 Video production activities</span>).

This page presents the results of using other sources of data to identify companies in receipt of funding,
collating their SIC codes and using this seed set to query the full companies house dataset.
