## Overview

The data presented on this page is derived from open data published by Arts Council England:
[Project Grants data](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ProjectGrants/project-grants-data).
The set of Excel spreadsheets is downloaded and combined into a single dataset for processing.

The processing selects only recipients based in Newcastle upon Tyne Local Authority.
The number and value of awards is aggregated by Year and Local Authority,
and an average award value is calculated for each aggregation.
