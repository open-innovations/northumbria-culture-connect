title: Seven Stories

description: |
   Once upon a time in 2005, an idea was born on the banks of the Tyne for a magical place which would protect and celebrate children’s books and all that goes into creating them.
   Today, we’re a unique asset to the North East of England, and an integral part of the nation’s literary heritage that can be accessed for free, here in the heart of Newcastle upon Tyne.

	<h2>Aims</h2>

	<p>
	Seven Stories took part in the data observatory pilot with the aim of better understanding:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>how children and caregivers experience Storytime sessions</li>
	<li>audience demographics and culture engagement trends</li>
	<li>the value and impacts of Storytime for children and their carers</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	They hoped to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>create new visual representations of their data</li>
		<li>evidence impact on visitors to help secure future funding</li>
		<li>expand data analysis from Storytime to better inform other programmes</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Data collection</h2>

	<p>
	The data observatory brought data to life from a sample of 103 visitors, including:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>77 paper survey responses</li>
		<li>9 online survey responses</li>
		<li>4 face to face interviews with caregivers</li>
		<li>13 face to face interviews with children</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Limitations of the study</h2>

	<h3>Evaluating impact through short term feedback</h3>

	<p>
	It's challenging to evaluate and evidence the impact of culture through this type of short term data collection, as the feedback is gathered during or very shortly after the visit. 
	</p>

	<h3>Research with young children</h3>

	<p>
	Children’s responses were often limited in detail and clarity, as they were between 2 and 8 years old and interacting with unfamiliar adult researchers.
	</p>

	<h3>Gaps in data due to non-mandatory questions</h3>

	<p>
	Some survey questions were optional to encourage participation and reduce completion time, resulting in gaps where respondents chose to skip them.

	<p>
	The most common audiences were families with children aged 3 to 4 years old and children aged 5 to 7 years old.
	</p>

	<p>
	This trend was common across all survey methods, highlighting that Storytime was particularly popular for these age groups.
	</p>

	<p>
	It’s important to note the high number of unknown responses in paper surveys, with 10 visitors choosing not to answer this question. This could be useful to consider in the future when collecting visitor data this way. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Online data also had a low response rate of only 9 visitors, making it hard to identify overall trends.

	<p>
	The majority of Storytime visitors identified as White or White British.
	</p>

	<p>
	A small but notable number of paper survey respondents identified as Asian or Asian British and Mixed or multiple ethnic groups, showing that Storytime events are attracting some diversity.
	</p>

	<p>
	However, these groups are underrepresented compared to the White or White British audience.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are also 13 ‘Unknown’ responses in the paper surveys, suggesting that many visitors chose not to state their ethnic group. The high proportion of ‘Unknown’ responses means the full diversity of Storytime’s audiences might not be captured.
	</p>

	<p>
	This highlights the need to develop targeted outreach for underrepresented groups and revise data collection methods.

	<p>
	29 respondents mentioned how Storytime promoted a love of reading and stories, a key part of promoting early literacy for children and enthusiasm for literature.
	</p>

	<p>
	Most participants mentioned that Storytime creates a fun, enjoyable and engaging experience for children, with 46 respondents noting this as a key takeaway.
	</p>

	<p>
	This suggests that Storytime is successfully delivering an experience that children find entertaining, which is crucial for engagement and encouraging repeat visits.
	</p>

	<p>
	Beyond enjoyment, Storytime also supports key developmental skills.
	</p>

	<p>
	Concentration or social skills were frequently highlighted, indicating that the sessions help children learn to focus and interact with others in a social setting.
	</p>

	<p>
	A smaller number of respondents also mentioned benefits related to imagination, creativity, confidence and relaxation.
	</p>

	<p>
	Literacy skills were only directly mentioned three times. While Storytime encourages a general love of stories, there may be opportunities to strengthen its language and framing to signal its direct impact on early reading and language development.

	<h2>Areas for improvement</h2>

	<p>
	There were a few areas for improvement highlighted by children or their caregivers.
	</p>

	<h3>More stories per session</h3>

	<p>
	Some caregivers and children felt the Storytime sessions were too short and would benefit from an additional story. This feedback was particularly noted on the day of the in-person research, when the storycatcher read two stories per session.
	</p>

	<h3>Improved seating</h3>

	<p>
	One respondent felt that “more and better seating” was required to make the environment comfortable for visitors.
	</p>

	<h2>Next steps</h2>

	<p>
	Currently, Seven Stories struggle to present the full scope of their impact to potential funders, but this case study has demonstrated how a "full 360° explanation" of their programming can be used for their benefit.
	</p>

	<p>
	Moving forward, Seven Stories intend to apply this model to other initiatives, particularly our learning programmes.
	</p>

	<p>
	Seven Stories plan to implement regular surveys to gather qualitative data and develop presentations that encourage more data-driven decision making throughout the organisation.
