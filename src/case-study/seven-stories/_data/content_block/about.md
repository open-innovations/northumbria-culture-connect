Our bustling seven-storey building attracts 75,000+ families every year, and has became a cultural hub within the Ouseburn Valley.

We believe we have a special responsibility to put stories at the heart of every single childhood regardless of circumstance, background or reading ability. Extensive research has proven that nurturing reading for pleasure will have life-long benefits for a child. Seven Stories works across the North East of England with schools and communities to promote and sustain reading for pleasure initiatives, improving literacy and oracy skills for children, young people and their families.
