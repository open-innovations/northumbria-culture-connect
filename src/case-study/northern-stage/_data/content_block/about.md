Northern Stage is a theatre where everyone is welcome.

We make and present contemporary theatre, live performance and creative programmes that spark connections, provoke curiosity and joy, and explore new ways of seeing the world from our home in the heart of Newcastle upon Tyne.

We promote creativity and creative practice and provide life-changing experiences for people who would not normally have access to such opportunities.

Northern Stage is an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation, which means funding thanks to National Lottery players plays a huge part in supporting our work.

We’d love for you to join us at a show, take part in a creative workshop or just stop by for a coffee in our lovely Café Bar.
