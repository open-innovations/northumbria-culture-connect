Life is a place where educators, researchers, clinicians and businesses work side-by-side on one site. It’s a unique concept, unlike anything else in the world.

It’s benefited thousands of people, in so many different ways. Babies brought into the world by groundbreaking fertility treatment. Children who visit the science centre, and see the world (and the stars) like never before. Researchers and clinicians whose work is helping people live better lives.

For more than two decades, it’s been the place where science comes to life.
