Dance City is a vibrant and friendly place where people come together to take part, enjoy, experience and talk about dance; where professional and aspiring dancers meet, learn and train; somewhere to watch world class dance performances and somewhere for all to come along and get involved in dance. People come to Dance City to socialise, learn new skills, keep fit and active, train professionally and find out more about dance. This all takes place under one roof, in our purpose-built dance-house, in the heart of Newcastle upon Tyne.
