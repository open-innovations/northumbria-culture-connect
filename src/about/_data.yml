    Culture Connect is an open access data observatory that brings together cultural data from across the North East.

    As more powers are handed down to local areas through English devolution, we need robust and ready data to:

    * better understand cultural engagement in the region
    * make informed decisions about funding
    * highlight barriers to success in the cultural sector
    * inform policy making so it accurately represents areas of growth and need
