## Findings and Recommendations

The page is a prototype, showing the potential for a Data Observatory which
hosts a rich set of validated information about organisations in the cultural
sector. There are limitations, not least of which is the limited number of
organisations in the pilot, and the limited amount of data that they are
providing.

Furthermore, the data quality of some sources (such as 360 Giving) has not been
validated, and it is possible that organisations who formerly presented their
data via 360 Giving have either stopped or are delayed submitting information.

Recommendations for future work include:

- Developing the service design to enable more cultural organisations to
  contribute income profiles and other funding-related data in a common format.
- Validation and exploration of data around funding, including detailed cross
  referencing different sources of information from e.g. 360 Giving, DCMS, Arts
  Council England.
- Encouragement of funders to publish high-quality, validated award data in a
  common format such as 360 Giving. The Data Observatory could provide a
  critical feedback loop in validating and enhancing quality of this data, as an
  active user of the data.
