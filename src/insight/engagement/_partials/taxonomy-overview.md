Currently, there is no unified system for capturing data on participation and engagement across culture organisations. As a result, it is challenging to identify sector-wide trends or understand engagement patterns at the local level. Culture organisations gather data independently, often using different methods, which makes comparing their findings difficult.

Standardising data collection will enable meaningful comparisons and provide a clearer picture of culture participation. This will not only highlight trends in the types of programmes being offered but also reveal who they are engaging with, and where there might be gaps or barriers to culture participation. These insights can then inform targeted interventions, enable better-informed policy decisions and allow culture ecosystems to advocate for investment and support in their region.

Existing open data infrastructure often fails to provide a comprehensive view of culture activity, particularly at the local level. This pilot project aims to address this gap by introducing a straightforward approach to data collection, initially tested with four pilot organisations, with plans to expand in the future.
