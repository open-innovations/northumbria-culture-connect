Currently, there is no unified system for capturing data on participation and engagement across culture organisations. As a result, it is challenging to identify sector-wide trends or understand engagement patterns at the local level. 

Culture organisations gather data independently, often using different methods, which makes comparing their findings difficult.

Standardising data collection can enable meaningful comparisons and provide a clearer picture of culture participation. It can highlight:

* the types of programmes being offered
* who they are engaging with
* gaps or barriers to culture participation

These insights will:

* inform targeted interventions
* enable better decision making
* allow culture ecosystems to advocate for investment and support in their region

Existing open data infrastructure often fails to provide a comprehensive view of culture activity, particularly at the local level. 

This pilot project aims to address this gap by introducing a straightforward approach to data collection, initially tested with <a href="https://dev.open-innovations.org/ncc/organisations/">4 culture organisations in Newcastle</a>.
