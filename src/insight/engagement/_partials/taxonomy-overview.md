In order to conduct meaningful analysis across the sector, we need to develop a
defined taxonomy of engagement activities and audiences. Desk research has shown
that this shared taxonomy of engagement in the cultural sector does not yet
exist.

We have started to map the data we currently hold for pilot organisations into a
taxonomy that can be validated through user research. This standard taxonomy
will form part of the data infrastructure developed in this pilot for the sector
and will allow for scalability of the programme going forward.

The taxonomy has two dimensions:

* **Activity category** What activity types are being offered by the organisation?
* **Audience** Who are the activities aimed at?
