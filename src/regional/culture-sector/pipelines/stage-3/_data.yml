title: Culture sector pipeline, stage 3
description: |
  Stage 3 combines the candidate organisations and the matches from the prior stage
  to produce the culture sector dataset. This is augmented with data from the Companies House
  and Charity Commission references, and adds in other companies that do not appear in the
  funding data sources, but which share SIC codes with the matched companies.
